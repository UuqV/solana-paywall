Did you know most Content Management Systems boil down to markdown editors? 

I don't think I subscribe to making things easy for "non-developers." I think that most people of a certain age have a familiarity with markdown, even if we don't know it by that name. Instead, I find that a lot of products just try to remove the product from its creators. Truly, these solutions just add a layer of complexity to something that might already be tricky. I believe in the ability of everyone to use a computer adeptly nowadays, provided they're provided simple instructions. The files for this blog are stored in a neat markdown format, making it not only easy, but portable to edit content. Personally, I use netlify for hosting my small sites. Once these files are committed, they're automatically deployed, so as long as you can teach your contributors to use the markdown editor of your choice, then commit their changes to git, there's no need for a bulky CMS.

This format is not only straightforward, but portable. The markdown format's universitality around the web makes it easy to transfer this content to whatever new paradigm. Not that you'd want to, when you can easily host all this content yourself!
