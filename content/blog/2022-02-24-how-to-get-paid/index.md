"I buy into the vision. How can I set up my own site and get paid?"

I happen to really appreciate how this module is separated, if I can say so myself.

If you want to use this site as a jumping off point, you can get all the [source code here](https://github.com/UuqV/solana-paywall-demo).

If you already have a site, you can use this tool [via npm](https://github.com/UuqV/solana-publish-module). Check how it's done in `package.json`.
