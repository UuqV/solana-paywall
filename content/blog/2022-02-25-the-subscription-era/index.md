Based on this screenshot from The Atlantic, by Amanda Mull, [We've Reached Peak Subscription](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/why-subscriptions-are-hard-to-cancel/623885/). With cognisant irony, Mull comments how although the subscription model is strained, the user should nonetheless subscribe to The Atlantic. It's no question the subscription model often is the only viable web revenue model. At least in the past decade, it sits in quiet symbiosis, but also competition, with ad revenue. At this point, we have the data to tell just how well these models work. While publishers start to notice subscriptions are bringing in less money than hoped, consumers are simultaneously noticing they offer them less value than they'd hoped.

So what does that mean for the future of web publishing? Traditionally, internet companies have two options for sources of revenue: Ads, and Subscriptions. Where subscriptions fall short, ads are often called upon by the organization to fill in revenue gaps. But now a third option is emerging: micropayments. The incentive to adopt such a paradigm, for both consumers and publishers alike, is huge. But there are obstacles, one huge one being user experience.

This project intends to empower emerging creators to monetize their work without relying on ads, subscriptions, or for that matter, even an employer. But in fact, even a DAO could benefit from adopting this paradigm. Web content creates a ton of value. Don't surrender that value just for middlemen.
