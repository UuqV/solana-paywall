Based on this screenshot from The Atlantic, by Amanda Mull, [We've Reached Peak Subscription](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/why-subscriptions-are-hard-to-cancel/623885/). With cognizant irony, Mull comments how although the subscription model is strained, how the user should nonetheless subscribe to The Atlantic. It's no question the subscription model has often been the only viable web revenue model alternative over the past decade, sitting in quiet symbiosis, but also competition, with ad revenue. At this point we have the data to tell just how well these models work. While publishers are noticing that subscriptions are bringing in less money than hoped, consumers are noticing they offer them less value than they'd hoped.

So what does that mean for the future of the web? Traditionally, internet companies have two options for sources of revenue: Ads, and subscriptions. Where subscriptions fall short, ads are often called upon to fill in the gaps. But now a third option is emerging: micropayments. The incentive to adopt such a paradigm, for both consumers and publishers alike, is huge. The missing piece is user experience.

This project intends to empower emerging creators to monetize their work without relying on ads or subscriptions, and to do so without requiring intermediaries.
