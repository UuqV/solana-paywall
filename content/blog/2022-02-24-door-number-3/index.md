Did your Sim dramatically quit their catering job, running off with the boss’ clients? Only to have their newfound fame quickly vanish, despite their solo success?

Now your Sim can Grasp for the Stars and become a household name heading their own daring flavor enterprise! Wow the world with your delicious dish recommendations and personal touch!

Where previously Restaurant Owner actions had no fame loot, this mod:
- Adds small fame loot to the “Check on Table” Interaction (+6.8 Fame, the same amount a critic would get for Reviewing Food)
- Adds medium fame loot to the “Recommend Dish” Interaction (+13.6 Fame, the same amount a critic would get for Writing an Article)

Are there other actions you’d like to see help you Get Famous? Let me know in the comments!
